            <p class="mb-6">
                Most freelancers operate from a position of weakness. They approach clients with what I call the <strong>"Begging Bowl" strategy</strong>. They scour job boards (Upwork, Fiverr), fighting against 50 other people for the lowest price, essentially saying: <em>"Please, sir, can I have some work?"</em>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                <strong>The Truth:</strong> High-value clients do not look at job boards. They are too busy running their businesses. If you want to make $10k/month, you must stop <em>applying</em> and start <em>hunting</em>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl text-white font-serif mb-4 mt-12">The "Selfish" Offer Principle</h3>
            <p class="mb-6">
                It sounds counter-intuitive, but to get what <em>you</em> want (money), you must be aggressively selfish about solving <em>their</em> problem.
